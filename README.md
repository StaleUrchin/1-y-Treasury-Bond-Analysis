# 10y-Treasury-Bond-Analysis
A Regression model that predicts the future 10 year treasury bond

The spirit of this project is to first create a graphical relationship between both average mortgage rate and its corresponding 10 year bond yield since 1971.  
It then attempts to forecast out future 10 yr bond yields based on a regression model accounting for a user inputted timeframe of quarterly 10y bond performance.
The final product of this reproducable environment is a projected 1 year forward looking interest rate as well as a 3 yr graphical regression model based on the user inputs.
